The first three files (1-Main_BC.py, 2-Main_TC.py, 3-Main_AD.py) compute the AUC of the algorithm on breast cancer, thyroid cancer and alzheimer's disease, respectively. The annotations in "1-Main_BC.py" explain the details of the program, and the other two files (2-Main_TC.py, 3-Main_AD.py) are similar to "1-Main_BC.py" except the input data.

The other three files (4-Rank_BC.py, 5-Rank_TC.py, 6-Rank_AD.py) compute the probability of each unknown gene being disease-associated and rank these genes based on their probabilities in decending order. Three ranked lists which contain the top 100 unknown genes is generated by the three programs.
